The scheme, which will be open till January 31, 2024, will be available for entities that were unable to submit their appeals against orders issued by the tax officer on or before March 31, 2023, according to the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC). The CBIC issued a notification with respect to the scheme on Thursday.  So far, the GST law allowed an assessee to file an appeal against an assessment order seeking taxes within three months of the tax officer passing such a demand order. This can be extended by one more month.  In its last meeting on October 7, the GST Council had approved this amnesty scheme for filing appeals. The entities willing to avail of the scheme will have to pre-deposit 12.5 per cent of the tax demand, against 10 per cent currently.  The move will facilitate a large number of taxpayers, who could not file an appeal in the past within the specified time period.  AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said the scheme would be a lifeline for those who might have missed the appeal deadline due to administrative errors or unforeseen circumstances.  This initiative can also promote enhanced compliance among taxpayers. By offering a fair and lenient approach to appeal filing, it encourages better cooperation with tax authorities and a willingness to resolve disputes or clarify tax matters.  \\\"Additionally, by allowing disputes to be resolved more efficiently, the scheme may reduce the burden on the legal system. This benefits both taxpayers and the tax administration by streamlining the appeal process and potentially reducing the need for prolonged litigation,\\\" Mohan added.\",\n          \"NEW YORK, Nov.  25, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, reminds investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Illumina, Inc. (\\u201cIllumina\\u201d or the \\u201cCompany\\u201d) (NASDAQ: ILMN) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Illumina securities between May 1, 2023 and October 16, 2023, both dates inclusive (the \\u201cClass Period\\u201d). Investors have until January 9, 2024 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Clickhereto participate in the action. On August 10, 2023, after the market closed, Illumina revealed that the SEC was investigating the Company\\u2019s statements regarding its recent acquisition of GRAIL, Inc. (\\u201cGRAIL\\u201d), including \\u201cconduct and compensation of certain members of Illumina and GRAIL management.\\u201d On this news, the Company\\u2019s stock price fell $4.64, or 2.5%, to close at $180.48 per share on August 11, 2023. Then, on October 17, 2023, Carl Icahn (\\u201cIcahn\\u201d) filed a complaint against current and former directors of Illumina, alleging direct and derivative claims of breaches of fiduciary duty. The complaint was filed under seal, but according to Reuters, Icahn \\u201ctold the 13D Monitor Active-Passive Investor Summit in New York on Tuesday that the lawsuit pertained to Illumina completing its acquisition of cancer diagnostic test maker Grail.\\u201d On this news, the Company\\u2019s stock price fell $7.42, or 5.6%, to close at $124.45 per share on October 18, 2023. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company\\u2019s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that certain of the Company\\u2019s insiders had personal financial motives for acquiring GRAIL; (2) that, contrary to Illumina\\u2019s attempts to discount Icahn\\u2019s criticism, Icahn had accurately concluded that insiders\\u2019 interests did not align with the Company\\u2019s best interests; and (3) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants\\u2019 positive statements about the Company\\u2019s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

meet its order quotas, but the industry has stabilized, and Synology is starting to roll out attractive deals for Black Friday. The highlight this time around is the DiskStation DS923+, which is now down to just $479 \\u2014 a $120 discount from its usual selling price of $599. The DS923+ debuted at the start of the year, and the 4-bay NAS has considerable upgrades; it is faster in daily use thanks to Ryzen hardware, you can now use M.2 drives for storage, and while it still retains dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, you can make the switch to 10 Gigabit networking via a $100 add-on. Anyway, what you need to know is that the DiskStation DS923+ is the best 4-bay Plex NAS you can get at the moment, and the fact that it's finally on sale is a big deal in and of itself. So if you're looking to upgrade your NAS, now is the time to act. Synology DiskStation DS923+: $599 $479 at Amazon The DiskStation DS923+ is the best 4-bay Plex NAS you can get at the moment. It has considerable upgrades, and you can use M.2 drives for storage. If you need a new NAS for Black Friday, this is the one to get.\\u00a0 The switch to Ryzen hardware has a lot of positives; it uses less power and is faster in most day-to-day tasks, but the one issue is that you don't get the ability to transcode Plex content. This isn't a huge limitation as Plex has a direct play option that works incredibly well on most devices, but if you're sharing your Plex library and want hardware transcoding, that's not possible here. Barring that, the DiskStation DS923+ is phenomenal \\u2014 it has meaningful upgrades across the board, and Synology has managed to extend its lead on the software front with the introduction of DSM 7.2, its latest OS. I used over a dozen NAS servers this year, and the DS923+ is the model I recommend to anyone that's interested in building a home media server. It ticks all the right boxes, and with the NAS now on sale for $479, this is the best time to pick it up. If previous sales are any indication, these servers tend to go out of stock pretty fast, and that's particularly true of the DS923+. So if you've been waiting to buy a new NAS, I'd suggest picking it up right now. Need hard drives to go with the NAS? I have you covered:\\u00a0 Seagate IronWolf 8TB NAS HDD: $174 $139 at Amazon The 8TB IronWolf is the ideal NAS HDD to slot into the DiskStation DS923+. It has proven long-term reliability \\u2014 I used it for over 30,000 hours \\u2014 and it has custom features designed to allow it to run 24/7 within a NAS.\\u00a0\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title_sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Neutral\",\n          \"Negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"all_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 29617,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"These Early October Prime Day Deals on Amazon Basics Products Are Great if You Want to Save on Essentials If you need to stock up on affordable essentials for the house, Amazon Basics products are great\\u2014and now they're on sale for October Prime Day.
